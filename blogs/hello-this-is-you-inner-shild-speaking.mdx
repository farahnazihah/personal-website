It turns out we’ve always taken for granted just how young we really are.

Being a year younger than most of the students in my academic year, I’ve always viewed my age as something to be proud of. I was often the youngest in my class. My friends treated me as _that child_, the youngest, the one who seemed a bit more _childish_ than the rest. And to be fair, they weren’t wrong—I _was_ the youngest. Oh, and to top it off, I’m also the youngest sibling and the youngest grandchild on my mother’s side. And mind you, I never deny it when someone calls me childish, It felt like part of my identity.

As I get older, I’ve learned when it’s okay to be childish and when I need to be a responsible adult. I’ve realized there are parts of me that can still be playful and others that need to grow up. Actually, I’m _still_ learning. But no matter what happens, I don’t want to completely grow up. I don’t want to become a boring adult.

We all have that one dream that we haven’t reached yet. Or for some people, dreams that we have decided to stop reached for. For me, it was becoming an animator or an astronomer.

We also have those things we loved as kids, like a cartoon we couldn’t miss or a character from a comic book who felt like a hero. They shaped how we saw the world. But as we grow up, we often trade those passions for responsibilities. Somewhere along the way, it’s like we’re told there’s no room for those things in our adult lives.

The older we become, the more we become realistic. Let’s face it—we couldn’t chase those dreams because of limits we couldn’t control. Money, time, health, or even our parents’ expectations. These barriers may prevent us from pursuing our childhood dreams exactly as we imagined, so we just gave up and let them fade away. Then at some point in our life, we just laughed at our own dreams.

The funny thing is, no matter how much we age, we’re still young. In the rush of adulthood, we tend to forget how young we actually are. We might feel older because of the pressures of life, but we’re still at a point where we can choose what kind of person we want to be. We’re still young enough to dream, to be excited by the world, and to hold onto that playful, curious side of ourselves.

Those cartoons we loved, those comic book characters—they’re symbols of the joy and wonder we felt as kids. And that’s something worth holding onto. Even if we can’t make every dream a reality, we can carry them with us as reminders of who we are at our core. Those dreams are a part of what makes us feel alive. They keep us connected to the child we once were—and the one we can still be.

Dreaming as a child is a privilege, and don’t you dare throw it away just because _you’ve grown up_. We’re still young, and there’s still time to keep those dreams alive, even if they live on in small ways, tucked inside our hearts.

To this day, I continue to embrace my dream of becoming an animator, seeking ways to work as closely as possible to that passion. I still look up at the night sky to greet my friend Rigel. Thousands of miles away from the place where I first dreamed of those goals, years after I first had them.
