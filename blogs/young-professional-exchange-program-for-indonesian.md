## Young Professional Exchange Program for Indonesian

The [Young Professional Exchange Program](https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/en/home/themen/arbeit/berufspraktikum.html) is a cooperation between the Swiss and Indonesian governments. You need to find a job on your own, and once you have a signed contract, you can apply for the program. I was lucky to stumble upon the job opening, but you can search for jobs through platforms like [jobs.ch](http://jobs.ch/), [Indeed](http://indeed.com/), [Job Room](http://job-room.ch/), [jobup.ch](http://jobup.ch/), [JobScout24](http://jobscout24.ch/), and of course, LinkedIn. I found these sites from my research online, though I didn’t try them personally, so make sure to verify their legitimacy.

Once you have a signed contract, you can apply for the program. There are two ways to do this:

1. **Apply on your own** alongside the national visa application to the Swiss Embassy. The required documents for the program are outlined in the instructions PDF from the [Swiss Migration Office website](https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/en/home/themen/arbeit/berufspraktikum.html). This includes your passport, signed job contract, university degree, and a filled-out form. For the national visa requirements, see [this page](https://www.eda.admin.ch/countries/indonesia/en/home/visa/entry-ch/more-90-days.html). This process usually takes 6-8 weeks.
2. **Have the company submit the application for you**. In this case, you'll receive an authorization letter from the Swiss Migration Office. You can then apply for the [national visa](https://www.eda.admin.ch/countries/indonesia/en/home/visa/entry-ch/more-90-days.html) with the authorization letter.

The process can be confusing, and we couldn’t find much information online from people who had gone through this program. Fortunately, my company was very helpful and took care of the application, speeding up the process.

Once you have the visa, you can enter Switzerland. After arriving, you must register your address within 14 days. You will receive a proof of residence, which you should keep as it will be needed for things like opening a bank account, getting insurance, etc. Your residence card should arrive a few weeks later, but the entire process can take some time.

I think that’s it! It might look simple, but brace yourself—it can be overwhelming, especially if you’re bad at paperwork (like me).

I struggled to find clear information about the process, so I wanted to share my experience here in the hope that it helps anyone else who gets accepted into the same program and feels confused about what to do. Also, feel free to send me an [email](mailto:farahnazihah102@gmail.com) if you have any questions—I’ll do my best to answer!

Wishing you the best of luck!
