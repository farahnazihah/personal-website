When I decided to add this blog feature to my personal website, I revisited the articles I wrote back in college. I wrote them to fulfill the requirements for a Software Engineering Project course, so they may not have been well-written. However, I still really like this particular topic even today, so I decided to re-write it with my current perspective. You can find the original version [here](https://farahnazihah.medium.com/programmers-are-stupid-213bf63d9abc).

A friend sent me [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06YWGaCpky8) years ago, back when I was still a college student. It was a video by Kenny Gunderman, about how being a good programmer doesn’t mean knowing everything; it means knowing how to learn.

After graduating from college, I genuinely felt lost. It seemed like I’d never be ready for the real world—I hadn’t learned enough or prepared long enough. Most of my friends already had their lives figured out: many were hired by big companies, some even abroad. A few had even secured senior roles before graduating. I felt left behind.

I kept telling myself that life isn't a competition. But at the same time, I didn’t want to become too content with where I was. I managed to secure my first full-time job a few months before graduating, and it was with a pretty well-known company too. But now... what? I constantly felt like I wasn’t good enough, as if most of my achievements were due to luck. I had never truly felt like I deserved what I got.

And exactly at that time, I got to learn about my new friend: [impostor syndrome](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-is-imposter-syndrome).

Graduating doesn’t mean we stop learning. In fact, I’ve discovered a lot of new frameworks that I had never heard of before. I’ve also learned about various tools and methods in software engineering. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve said, "No, I don’t know, never heard of it," whenever someone asked if I was familiar with certain tools or frameworks.

To this day, I’ve changed companies three times. Each move forced me to learn a new environment, new codebases, new methodologies, and even new code smells. Every time I joined a new company, the first thought that came to mind was, "I’m so stupid." It felt like I hadn’t learned anything at all.

[The Dunning-Kruger effect](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/dunning-kruger-effect) is programmers' best friend. I’m sure almost every programmer has experienced it. But I didn’t realize it was a cycle: sometimes triggered by big problems, sometimes by something as small as a one-story-point task.

I felt stupid every time I was tasked with something I had never done
before, and I would easily get frustrated. But every time I was on the verge of
giving up, I found a way through. And before I knew it, I had finished the task.

Deep down, I know this field is so vast that I’ll never be able to know everything. I still need to learn how to accept that. I need to push myself just the right amount—not so much that it stresses me out.

Because, just like Kenny Gunderman said in the video,

> That's the thing about tech. You don't know everything. But you learn how to learn, you learn how to solve, when the time comes. You learn to be comfortable in the unknown.

Until this day, I’m still learning to be comfortable in the unknown. I’m still learning how to learn and how to solve. But someday, I believe I’ll be able to handle the "Valley of Despair"s. Because, at the end of the day, **being a lifelong learner is the best thing you can choose to be.**
