## how I ended up as a developer in Switzerland

This blog will be more of a casual story about how I got here. It’s not a really a “how-to”, but I hope you can take away one or two things from my experience.

### Job Application (March-April)

I was in a state where I was desperately looking for a way out of Indonesia. I applied to multiple job openings, mostly in Japan and Singapore. With my Japanese skills almost non-existent and not being an NUS/NTU graduate, of course I was at the bottom of the list.

It all started in March when my brother sent me a message with a tweet he had found. The tweet shared a job opening in Switzerland, part of a program from the Swiss government called the “Young Professional Exchange Program.” This program is actually only for 6 months, with the possibility to extend until max 18 months.

(Wanted to attach my brother’s message, but I lost my phone in July, remember? Lost the messages 😞)

The person who shared the tweet is Indonesian (now my supervisor here), and he was looking for a junior developer. The job requirements surprisingly matched my skills and experience, so I thought why not give it a shot? I never actually dreamed of working in Europe, but I was willing to take any opportunity to leave Indonesia, even temporarily.

The first stage of the job selection process was an interview. It was in English, and there was a short coding test. To be honest, I was on adrenaline rush, saying whatever came to mind, but I had prepared thoroughly for the interview, so I think it went just okay. Here’s a little tip for job interviews: prepare (list possible questions, revisit the basics), research (learn about the company, the program, and how it will impact your career and life), and definitely ask for feedback. My supervisor also made a Twitter thread on this:

A couple of weeks later, I received an email inviting me to the next stage: a technical test with a two-week deadline. I was also offered $150 for completing the challenge. Honestly, I was confused — who pays someone applying for their job? Maybe this is how life works in countries that respect your time (tdk spt indo lol🫠). Long story short, I completed the task, with a little help from some friends.

I want to thank my brother, friends, and seniors who supported me through the job application process, helped me gather all the information I needed, and kept it a secret from everyone else until I was ready to share the news myself. 😇🤫

### Job Offer and Preparations (May–July)

Sometime in May, I received an email with the contract, asking for my signature if I agreed to take the opportunity (I remember being at the office when I got the email — pretty sure some of my colleagues noticed my panic). At this point, I started to go crazy, overthinking every possible outcome.

> _This program is only for 6 months — what if I can’t find a job when I go back to Indo? I like my current company and love the people; it hasn’t even been a year yet. Is it really worth leaving for a contract position? We have so many backlogs — will it be okay if I leave? I can’t speak German at all — how will I survive? Everyone says Switzerland is the most expensive country — will the salary cover the cost of living and still allow me to save? I’ve lived with my parents my whole life, never lived on my own, and now I have to live alone in Switzerland? What if I get sick? Will I struggle to find halal food? I can’t handle cold — just how cold is it going to be?_

…and a million other questions kept popping up.

Thanks to my family and friends, though, they helped me decide to take this opportunity (special thanks to Indira, who slapped some sense into me from every direction — here’s ur special shoutout girl, r u happy now?). None of the questions above were answered, of course. But I thought maybe it's time to step out of my comfort zone — what’s the worst that could happen? So, well, I signed the contract.

From this point on, my plans were a mess. I had so many things I wanted to do before the end of 2024, but I guess everything got postponed. Now, I had to handle the work permit, visa, and other required documents. I’m terrible at paperwork, so this period was super stressful. Sorry to everyone who was affected by my stress 😞. The work permit came out a little late, but thankfully, everything else went smoothly. For those who want to know more about the whole process for the visa, work permit, etc., I’ve made a separate article about it <link>, which is way more informative than this yapping blog.

### Arrival (August)

Long story short, I met up with a lot of friends before my departure, did some last-minute packing, left behind a ton of things, and finally arrived in Basel. Not many people knew I was moving abroad, so I got a lot of questions, but I was too tired to answer them (sorry guys😞 take this blog as the answer). I was already exhausted before I even left home, so my first week here was a complete mess. I stayed in an Airbnb for a month, and fortunately, the host was incredibly welcoming and helpful. My supervisor also did a lot to help me adjust to life here.

The paperwork isn’t over yet. I still have to deal with apartment hunting, my address registration, residence permit, bank, health insurance, and so on (and it’s not even finished as I’m writing this).

There are plenty of Turkish stores that sell halal meat (chicken, processed meat, etc.), so I don’t have to worry about that. There are also lots of vegan options, and most products in the supermarket have vegan or vegetarian labels, so it’s surprisingly easy to avoid non-halal food, even tho I still haven’t found any halal restaurant. And yes, I’m still eating indomie. I really miss mie ayam, tho. Tried looking up the recipe, but it’s just too much work (males😞).

This blog is getting too long, so I’ll stop here for now. I’ll continue sharing my story another time. Tschüss!

Ah! Shoutout to my supervisor: <link>\
His blog and Twitter will definitely help you especially if you’re a web developer.

<spoiler>((just realized this blog has “developer” in the title, but I haven’t even mentioned anything about being a developer, oh well lol sorry for the clickbait then😇))</spoiler>
