I used to think I was always the second choice. Whether it was being the "substitute player" for the Olympiad team in high school, consistently getting second place in games, or being the person people turn to only when their first choice isn't available.

Just recently I realized that this feeling was just an illusion, masking the opportunities I’ve been given.

I’ve always believed in luck. But luck isn’t as random as it seems—it’s what happens when preparation meets opportunity. You have to be ready, so that when the opportunity comes, you can seize it. That is _luck_.

Many people have told me I’m lucky—apparently in more ways than I’d even noticed. Honestly, I agree. A lot of the time, I feel like I’m just lucky to be where I am and to have what I have. I often think I don’t even deserve the things I’ve been given. But a friend reminded me yesterday that my “luck” wasn’t purely chance. I got lucky because I prepared for it. It’s unfair to think you don’t deserve something just because you were lucky—you earned it by putting in the work.

And all the second places I’ve achieved, they’re proof of my preparation. Maybe I wasn’t prepared enough, or maybe I just wasn’t lucky yet. We often forget the “first-place” moments we’ve had because we focus too much on the “second-place” ones.
