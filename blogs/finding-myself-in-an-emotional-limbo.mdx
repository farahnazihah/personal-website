For months, I’ve felt like something is wrong with me, but I can’t quite figure out what. I don’t feel lonely, I’m not homesick, Im not living frugally,I don’t feel particularly stressed, but I keep feeling like I’m just surviving, not living. I thought I’ll get over it later anyway when I finally get used to my new life here. But before I knew it, I ended up in a sort of limbo.

Suddenly all my hobbies stopped feeling fulfilling. I couldn’t start a new series, can’t even finish one episode of anime, I keep rewatching comfort animes, my novels just sat untouched on my reading list, can’t even enjoy the games that I loved, even the foods I once craved no longer appealed to me. For a whole month, I couldn’t find joy in the things I’m supposed to love.

But why? I don’t know. I tried journaling, brainstorming, even counseling. But that last psychologist probably just a bad match for my case lmao. I felt frustrated bcs he didn’t seem to get it, even after I yapped for nearly an hour. It felt like he was just trying to fit my stories into a textbook case.

I’m frustrated and tired, desperately want to feel joy in everyday life, I went to a lot of steps before realizing my state right now.

I realized I’ve lost my sense of boundaries simply because I didn’t know where or when to set them. I used to be pretty good at that, so maybe I just stopped paying attention after I moved here. I kept telling myself, “It’s fine, not a big deal,” for months. With constantly moving, I couldn’t build a daily routine either. So my day-to-day life turned into just surviving whatever comes.

I still don’t fully understand money. I’ve stopped converting CHF to IDR (because it’s SUPER stressful), but I haven’t really grasped what counts as cheap or expensive for non-daily purchases like furniture or electronics. So I end up being frugal just because things feel expensive. (Mind you, some of these items are actually just a small percentage of my salary, but it’s hard to understand that after 22 years living in Depok.)

I’ve lost my goals. All the dreams I had since I was little just disappeared. Now that I live alone and can technically do anything. I’ve lost direction.

I also realized I’ve become emotionally detached. I tend to ignore others here, partly so I won’t notice if someone is being racist or something. Except for the occasional small gestures like “Good morning” or a smile from another hijabi. We can’t control everything, and emotional detachment is actually a valid survival strategy, especially in your early days as an expat. But maybe I overdid it.

This emotional detachment actually came up in a counseling session, but we didn’t dive too deeply into it. So I started reflecting again. My parents didn’t neglect my emotions, but they often invalidated them. Because of that, they’ve never been the first people I turn to when I’m feeling something. I used to be really bad at managing emotions until my first counseling session in 2021. I learned a lot since then, but now I suspect I’ve been suppressing my emotions without realizing it. I thought I was just getting better at handling them, but maybe I’ve been pushing them down instead.

I’ve been (and still am) very sensitive during this period. So I apologize if I haven’t responded the way you expected, or if there are things I promised to do but haven’t yet.

I’m still not fully “recovered”, still trying to find my way out of this limbo. and my very first step is to treat myself to a cup of matcha whenever I feel like it, and simping over artists like Tatsuya Kitani, Eve, and Yorushika. I just hope following people with a burning passion for what they do, and who are persistent with their goals, might teach me a thing or two while I’m in this state. While my hobbies haven’t fully returned, I’ll keep crawling little by little until I rediscover what I truly love. So if you fed up of me talking about those artists, mind yourself to get the fuck out thank you.

p.s. go watch "Summer Ghost" if you haven't already.
